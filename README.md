Face Tracer
================

This is a simple Jquery function that selects image source accourding to mouse position in  a parent element.
I've used it to change face images and make an animation that the face looks to pointer at all time. but it can be changed with any creative ideas.

1 - you need 16 images for 360/16 degrees range.
2 - select in which parent element (e.g. body) the pointer would be traced

I'll work to make it dynamic in number of images as soon as I have time
